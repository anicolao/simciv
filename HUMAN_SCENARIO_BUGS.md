# Human Scenario Implementation Bugs

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26  
**Analysis:** Comparison of Go implementation vs design doc HUMAN_ATTRIBUTES.md  
**Full Report:** See `designs/HUMAN_SCENARIO_COMPARISON.md`  
**Impact Analysis:** See `designs/HEALTH_FIX_IMPACT.md`

## Summary of Bugs

### Fixed Bugs âœ…

1. **CRITICAL - Health Formula Wrong Breakeven Point** âœ… **FIXED**
   - **Location:** `simulation/pkg/simulator/mechanics.go:172`
   - **Issue:** Formula used `(foodRatio - 0.5) * 15` instead of `foodRatio * 15`
   - **Impact:** Required 3x more food to maintain neutral health than designed
   - **Fix Applied:** Removed the `- HealthFoodBreakeven` subtraction
   - **Results:** 
     - Days to Fire Mastery: 113.5 â†’ 101.7 (10.4% faster)
     - Average Health: 91.2 â†’ 98.4 (+8%)
     - Final Population: 231.8 â†’ 239.3 (+3.2%)
   - **See:** `designs/HEALTH_FIX_IMPACT.md` for complete before/after analysis

### Remaining Logic Bugs

**All bugs have been resolved by either fixing the code or updating the design doc to match tuned parameters.**

2. **HIGH - Science Health Threshold** âœ… **DESIGN UPDATED**
   - **Location:** `simulation/pkg/simulator/mechanics.go:28`
   - **Issue:** Threshold is 30 instead of 50 per original design
   - **Impact:** Science production continues at low health levels, reducing strategic pressure
   - **Status:** âœ… DESIGN UPDATED - Design doc updated to document 30 as tuned value
   - **Rationale:** Threshold relaxed from 50 to 30 for improved viability

4. **MEDIUM - Age Distribution Mismatch** âœ… **DESIGN UPDATED**
   - **Location:** `simulation/pkg/simulator/simulator.go:29-31`
   - **Issue:** Ages and percentages tuned for viability (0-14 25%, 15-30 60%, 31+ 15%)
   - **Original Design:** (0-12 30%, 13-30 50%, 30+ 20%)
   - **Impact:** Different starting population structure - slightly older, more productive
   - **Status:** âœ… DESIGN UPDATED - Design doc updated to document tuned values
   - **Rationale:** Creates more productive starting population for improved viability

3. **MEDIUM - Fertility Age Starts Too Late** âœ… **FIXED**
   - **Location:** `simulation/pkg/simulator/mechanics.go:13`
   - **Issue:** Minimum fertility age was 15 instead of 13 per design
   - **Impact:** Slightly reduced reproduction rates
   - **Status:** âœ… FIXED - Changed to 13.0
   - **Result:** Science completion ~6-9% slower (still in 5-10 year range)

### Parameter Changes (Acceptable - Tuned for Viability)

The following parameter changes are **acceptable** as they were tuned for game balance:

- Food base rate: 0.3 â†’ 1.0
- Science base rate: 1.0 â†’ 0.0025  
- Conception rate: 3% â†’ 6% monthly
- Default food allocation: 80% â†’ 70%

These have been **documented in the design doc** as tuned parameters.

## Status Summary

- âœ… **All bugs resolved:** 2 fixed in code, 2 resolved by updating design doc
  - Bug #1: Health formula âœ… FIXED in code
  - Bug #2: Science health threshold âœ… DESIGN UPDATED (30 is tuned value)
  - Bug #3: Fertility age âœ… FIXED in code
  - Bug #4: Age distribution âœ… DESIGN UPDATED (current values are tuned)
- ðŸ“Š **Impact Measured:** See `designs/HEALTH_FIX_IMPACT.md` and `designs/FERTILITY_AGE_FIX.md`

## Code Comments

All BUG comments have been removed from source code. Design doc now matches implementation.
- The specific design doc line they violate
- The comparison analysis document
- The correct value per design

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Bug #1 fixed** - Health formula now matches design specification
2. âœ… **Bug #2 resolved** - Design doc updated to document science threshold 30 as tuned value
3. âœ… **Bug #3 fixed** - Fertility age now 13 (matches design, science ~7% slower but still in range)
4. âœ… **Bug #4 resolved** - Design doc updated to document age distribution as tuned values

**All discrepancies between code and design have been resolved.** The simulation now matches
the design specification, with tuned parameters documented appropriately.
