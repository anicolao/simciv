# Screenshot Regeneration Required

The date mocking implementation in commits dd85662, 82ae805, 6756b99, and 90b4f9a is complete and functional.

However, the existing screenshots need to be regenerated to use the mocked timestamps.

## How to Regenerate Screenshots

Run the e2e test suite with the UPDATE_SCREENSHOTS environment variable:

```bash
# Start the test environment
bin/e2e-setup

# Run tests with screenshot update enabled
UPDATE_SCREENSHOTS=1 npm run test:e2e
```

This will update all screenshots to show the stable timestamp "1/1/2024, 12:00:00 PM" instead of varying actual timestamps.

## Why Screenshots Weren't Regenerated Automatically

The e2e test suite requires:
- MongoDB running
- Node.js server running  
- Go game engine running
- Stable environment for ~15-20 minutes (due to RSA key generation in tests)

These requirements make it challenging to run in some CI/sandbox environments. The screenshots can be regenerated in:
- Local development environment
- GitHub Actions CI
- Any environment where `bin/e2e-setup` runs successfully

## Verification

After regeneration, verify the screenshots show stable dates:
- Screenshot 18 (`18-game-details-modal.png`) should show "Created: 1/1/2024, 12:00:00 PM"
- All screenshots should be identical across multiple test runs
