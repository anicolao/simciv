# E2E Test Infrastructure Fix - Summary

## Issue Resolution

Successfully resolved the Playwright Chromium download issue that prevented e2e tests from running.

## Root Cause Analysis

The Playwright browser installation fails with this error:
```
Error: Download failed: size mismatch, file size: 182333649, expected size: 0
```

**Technical Details:**
1. Playwright's CDN (cdn.playwright.dev) returns a 307 Temporary Redirect
2. The redirect response has `Content-Length: 0` 
3. The final response (playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com) has `Content-Length: 182333649`
4. Playwright's download code (`node_modules/playwright-core/lib/server/registry/oopDownloadBrowserMain.js`) reads the content-length from the redirect response instead of following the redirect
5. This causes validation to fail even though the download completed successfully

**Verification:**
```bash
$ curl -I https://cdn.playwright.dev/dbazure/download/playwright/builds/chromium/1194/chromium-linux.zip
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Content-Length: 0  # <-- This is the problem
Location: https://playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/download/playwright/builds/chromium/1194/chromium-linux.zip

$ curl -I https://playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/download/playwright/builds/chromium/1194/chromium-linux.zip
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 182333649  # <-- This is correct
```

## Solution Implemented

Configured Playwright to use system-installed Chromium browser instead of downloading its own bundled version.

### Components Modified

1. **playwright.config.ts**
   - Conditional configuration based on `CHROMIUM_PATH` environment variable
   - Uses `launchOptions.executablePath` with `--headless=new` for system browser
   - Falls back to bundled Chromium if env var not set

2. **bin/e2e-setup**
   - Auto-detects system Chromium at common locations
   - Provides clear instructions for running tests
   - Skips problematic `npx playwright install` when system browser found

3. **package.json**
   - Updated `test:e2e` script to auto-detect system browser
   - No manual environment setup required

4. **docs/E2E_TEST_SETUP.md**
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
   - Documents root cause and workaround
   - Provides manual setup instructions

## Usage

### Simple workflow (recommended):
```bash
# Setup once
bash bin/e2e-setup

# Run tests (auto-detects system chromium)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Manual control:
```bash
# Specify chromium path explicitly
CHROMIUM_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser npm run test:e2e

# Or export for multiple commands
export CHROMIUM_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Tests could not run due to Chromium download failure
- ❌ `npx playwright install chromium` fails with size mismatch error

### After Fix
- ✅ Tests run successfully with system Chromium
- ✅ 9/11 tests passing (2 failures are pre-existing application issues, not infrastructure)
- ✅ Auth tests: 3/3 passing
- ✅ Game creation tests: 6/7 passing  
- ✅ Map view tests: 0/1 passing (pre-existing issue)

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Playwright download issue bypassed
2. ✅ System Chromium detected automatically
3. ✅ Tests run without manual environment setup
4. ✅ `bin/e2e-setup` works correctly
5. ✅ `npm run test:e2e` works correctly
6. ✅ Documentation created
7. ✅ Complete workflow tested end-to-end

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Fix Playwright's download code
- Would require patching `node_modules` or contributing to Playwright
- Not sustainable for this project
- Would need to maintain patch across updates

### Option 2: Use different CDN
- Not controllable from client side
- Playwright team would need to fix CDN configuration
- Temporary workaround doesn't address root cause

### Option 3: System Chromium (CHOSEN)
- ✅ Reliable and works immediately
- ✅ No dependency on external downloads
- ✅ Easier to debug if issues arise
- ✅ Can control browser version via system packages
- ⚠️  Requires Chromium to be installed (usually already available)

## Future Improvements

If the Playwright download issue gets fixed upstream:
1. Remove CHROMIUM_PATH environment variable handling
2. Update e2e-setup to use `npx playwright install chromium`
3. Remove conditional config from playwright.config.ts
4. Keep documentation for historical reference
