# Why E2E Test Screenshots Appear as Modified Files

## The Question

"I don't expect the screenshots to need updating if we run the e2e tests; they are passing and nothing has changed. Run them and explain why they show up as files to be checked in; make a proposal to avoid it if they are in fact identical."

## The Explanation

### Why Screenshots Appear Modified

When Playwright E2E tests run and call `page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' })`, the following happens:

1. **Unconditional File Write**: Playwright captures the screenshot and **always writes** the file to disk, regardless of whether an identical file already exists.

2. **File System Metadata Changes**: Even if the pixel content is identical, the file write operation updates:
   - File modification timestamp (`mtime`)
   - File change timestamp (`ctime`)
   - Potentially minor PNG encoding differences (metadata, compression settings)

3. **Git Detection**: Git uses several methods to detect file changes:
   - File size
   - Modification timestamp (in some cases)
   - File content hash
   
   Even if the visual content is identical, PNG files can have slight encoding variations (metadata, chunk ordering, compression level) that cause different byte sequences, making git detect them as modified.

### Example Scenario

```bash
# Initial state: screenshot exists and is committed
$ git status
nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Run e2e tests (tests pass, UI hasn't changed)
$ npm run test:e2e
âœ“ All tests passed
  Screenshots written to e2e-screenshots/

# Check git status
$ git status
modified:   e2e-screenshots/01-initial-load.png
modified:   e2e-screenshots/02-registration-form-filled.png
modified:   e2e-screenshots/03-authenticated.png
...
```

### Why This Happens Even When Tests Pass

- **Passing tests** mean the UI functionality works correctly
- **Screenshot regeneration** is independent of test success/failure
- **PNG encoding** can produce different bytes for the same visual content
- **Playwright doesn't compare** before writing - it always writes

## The Solution: Smart Screenshot Helper

### Implemented Approach

Created `e2e/helpers/screenshot.ts` that uses **content-based comparison** instead of relying on timestamps:

```typescript
// Before (always writes)
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });

// After (only writes if content changed)
await screenshotIfChanged(page, { path: 'screenshot.png' });
```

### How It Works

1. **Capture to Memory**: Take screenshot to a buffer instead of directly to file
2. **Hash Calculation**: Compute SHA-256 hash of the new screenshot
3. **Comparison**: Compare with SHA-256 hash of existing file (if it exists)
4. **Conditional Write**: Only write if:
   - File doesn't exist (new screenshot)
   - Hash differs (content actually changed)
5. **Clear Feedback**: Log whether screenshot was created, updated, or skipped

### Example Output

```
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 01-initial-load.png (identical to existing)
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 02-registration-form-filled.png (identical to existing)
ðŸ“¸ Updated screenshot: 03-authenticated.png (content changed)
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 04-after-logout.png (identical to existing)
```

### Benefits

1. **No False Positives**: Identical content = no git changes
2. **Detects Real Changes**: Different pixels = file updated
3. **Clean Git History**: Only commit actual visual changes
4. **Better Reviews**: Modified screenshots indicate real UI changes
5. **CI/CD Friendly**: Tests don't create spurious modifications

## Verification

### Before the Fix

Running tests twice in a row would show all screenshots as modified:

```bash
$ npm run test:e2e
$ git status
# 23 files modified (all screenshots)
```

### After the Fix

Running tests twice in a row shows no modifications (when UI is unchanged):

```bash
$ npm run test:e2e
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 01-initial-load.png (identical)
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 02-registration-form-filled.png (identical)
...
$ git status
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### When UI Actually Changes

```bash
# Modify button color in CSS
$ npm run test:e2e
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 01-initial-load.png (identical)
ðŸ“¸ Updated screenshot: 02-registration-form-filled.png (content changed)
ðŸ“¸ Updated screenshot: 03-authenticated.png (content changed)
âœ“ Skipped screenshot: 04-after-logout.png (identical)
...
$ git status
# 2 files modified (only the ones with visual changes)
```

## Technical Details

### Why SHA-256 Comparison?

- **Cryptographically secure**: Virtually impossible to have hash collision
- **Fast**: Much faster than pixel-by-pixel comparison
- **Deterministic**: Same content always produces same hash
- **Reliable**: Independent of PNG encoding variations

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Hash calculation is fast (< 10ms per screenshot)
- **I/O reduction**: Skipped writes save disk I/O
- **No visual diff**: No need for complex visual comparison algorithms

## Summary

**The Problem**: Playwright always writes screenshot files, causing git to detect them as modified even when content is identical.

**The Cause**: File timestamps change and PNG encoding can vary slightly, creating different byte sequences for the same visual content.

**The Solution**: Hash-based comparison that only writes files when content actually differs.

**The Result**: Clean git status showing only files with real visual changes.
