    Error: Screenshot mismatch: 30-gameplay-ui-square.png

    The screenshot differs from the expected version.

    Next steps:
    1. Inspect the screenshot at: e2e-screenshots/30-gameplay-ui-square.png
    2. If the visual change is correct and expected:
       - Run: UPDATE_SCREENSHOTS=1 npm run test:e2e
       - Verify tests pass: npm run test:e2e
       - Commit the updated screenshot
    3. If the visual change is incorrect:
       - Fix the source of the visual difference
       - Revert the screenshot: git checkout -- e2e-screenshots/30-gameplay-ui-square.png
       - Run tests again: npm run test:e2e
