# SimCiv Minimal Simulator Expansion: Stone Knapping
## Adding a Second Technology to Validate Multi-Tech Simulation

### Document Status
**Version:** 0.0022 (Revised)  
**Status:** Design Proposal  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-05  
**Purpose:** Specification for the smallest viable expansion of the minimal simulator to include a second technology with realistic prehistoric research timeframes (5-10 years per major technology)

---

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the **smallest possible increment** to expand the minimal simulator's scope beyond Fire Mastery. The goal is to add production code for a second technology that is tested similarly to the existing Fire Mastery test.

**Key Decision: Stone Knapping**

After reviewing the technology tree designs and the existing minimal simulation, **Stone Knapping** is selected as the second technology because it:

1. **Simplest Addition**: Level 0 technology with no prerequisites (available immediately)
2. **Clear Game Impact**: Provides +20% food production bonus (via improved hunting/gathering efficiency)
3. **Tests Core Systems**: Validates the simulation can handle multiple technologies
4. **Minimal Code Changes**: Requires only ~50-100 lines of new production code
5. **Natural Progression**: Represents the next logical survival technology after fire

**Success Criteria:**

Both the existing Fire Mastery test and the new Stone Knapping test must pass, demonstrating that:
- Populations can research multiple technologies
- Technology effects stack correctly (Fire Mastery: +15% food, Stone Knapping: +20% food)
- The simulation remains viable with two research goals

---

## Rationale for Stone Knapping

### Why Stone Knapping (Not Another Tech)?

**Considered Alternatives:**

1. **Basic Foraging** - More complex, requires terrain-dependent logic
2. **Primitive Shelter Construction** - Requires shelter capacity mechanics
3. **Primitive Hunting** - Too similar to food production, less distinct benefit
4. **Natural Shelter Utilization** - Terrain-dependent

**Why Stone Knapping Wins:**

| Criterion | Stone Knapping | Alternatives |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Prerequisites | None (Level 0) | None to minimal |
| Code Complexity | Low (simple multiplier) | Medium to high |
| Game Impact | Clear (+20% food) | Variable |
| Test Simplicity | Very simple | More complex |
| Distinct from Fire | Yes (tools vs. cooking) | Some overlap |

Stone Knapping provides the **minimal viable expansion** while introducing meaningful new functionality.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Minimal Simulator (as of 0.0006)

**Technologies:**
- Fire Mastery (100 science points, +15% food production via cooking)

**Mechanics:**
- Food production: Base rate × terrain × fire bonus (if unlocked)
- Science production: Work hours × science rate × health modifier
- Population: 100 starting, with birth/death mechanics
- Default allocation: 70% food / 30% science

**Test Coverage:**
- 50 seed-based deterministic tests
- Fire Mastery typically unlocked in ~140 days (0.38 years) **← REQUIRES ADJUSTMENT**
- 100% viability rate with 70/30 allocation

**Issue with Current Science Rate:**
The current science production rate (ScienceBaseRate = 0.00015) is tuned for Fire Mastery to unlock in ~140 days (0.38 years), which is far too fast for the desired 5-10 year timeframe. This needs to be adjusted significantly slower to achieve the target research times.

### Gap: No Multi-Technology Testing

The current simulator has only one technology, so it cannot test:
- ✗ Multiple research goals
- ✗ Technology prerequisite chains
- ✗ Stacking technology bonuses
- ✗ Research prioritization decisions

---

## Design: Stone Knapping Addition

### Technology Specification (from 0.0004_TECH_TREE.md)

**Stone Knapping**
- **Level**: 0 (immediately available)
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Research Cost**: 500 science points (5x Fire Mastery cost to ensure sequential research)
- **Population Required**: 5 minimum (always satisfied with 100 starting pop)
- **Resource Requirements**: None (simplified - design mentions stone resources, omitted for minimal version)

**Effects:**
- +20% food gathering efficiency (applied to base food production)
- Stacks multiplicatively with Fire Mastery (+15%)
- Combined effect: 1.0 × 1.15 × 1.20 = 1.38 (+38% food production)

**Rationale for Research Cost:**
- Fire Mastery: 100 science points → 5-10 years to research
- Stone Knapping: 500 science points → 5+ additional years after Fire Mastery
- Total research time: 10-15+ years for both technologies
- Sequential unlocking ensures distinct research phases and testing of prerequisite-like progression

### Implementation Changes

#### 1. Update Technology State (types.go)

```go
// MinimalCivilizationState (add new field)
type MinimalCivilizationState struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // Technology
    HasFireMastery     bool // Research goal 1 (unlocks at 100 science, 5-10 years)
    HasStoneKnapping   bool // Research goal 2 (unlocks at 600 science, 12-17 years) [NEW]
    
    // ... existing fields ...
}
```

#### 2. Adjust Science Production Rate (mechanics.go)

**Critical Change: Science Rate Adjustment**

The current `ScienceBaseRate = 0.00015` produces ~140 days to Fire Mastery. To achieve 5-10 years (1825-3650 days) for Fire Mastery:

```go
// Current rate (TOO FAST):
// ScienceBaseRate = 0.00015 → ~140 days to 100 science points

// New rate (ADJUSTED FOR 5-10 YEARS):
ScienceBaseRate = 0.000011 // Adjusted ~14x slower → 1825-3650 days to 100 science
```

**Calculation:**
- Target: 100 science points in 1825-3650 days (5-10 years)
- With 100 population, 70% food allocation, ~30 work hours/day on science
- Science per day needed: 100 / 2750 (middle of range) ≈ 0.036 points/day
- Science per hour: 0.036 / 30 ≈ 0.0012
- After health modifier (0.5 when health < 30): 0.00024 effective
- Base rate adjustment: 0.00015 → 0.000011 (≈13.6x slower)

**Note:** This rate may need fine-tuning during implementation testing to hit the exact 5-10 year target.

#### 3. Update Starting Conditions (simulator.go)

No changes needed - both technologies start as `false` (not unlocked).

#### 4. Update Food Production (mechanics.go)

```go
// produceFood calculates food production for the day
func produceFood(foodHours float64, hasFireMastery bool, hasStoneKnapping bool, terrainMultiplier float64) float64 {
    multiplier := 1.0
    
    if hasFireMastery {
        multiplier *= 1.15 // +15% from cooking
    }
    
    if hasStoneKnapping {
        multiplier *= 1.20 // +20% from better tools [NEW]
    }
    
    return foodHours * FoodBaseRate * multiplier * terrainMultiplier
}
```

#### 5. Add Technology Unlock Check (mechanics.go)

```go
// Constants (add to existing)
const (
    // ... existing constants ...
    
    StoneKnappingScienceRequired = 600.0 // [NEW] - Total 600 science (500 more than Fire Mastery)
)

// checkTechnologyUnlocks checks if any technologies should be unlocked [RENAMED from checkTechnologyUnlock]
func checkTechnologyUnlocks(state *MinimalCivilizationState) []string {
    unlocked := []string{}
    
    // Check Fire Mastery
    if !state.HasFireMastery && state.SciencePoints >= FireMasteryScienceRequired {
        state.HasFireMastery = true
        unlocked = append(unlocked, "Fire Mastery")
    }
    
    // Check Stone Knapping [NEW]
    if !state.HasStoneKnapping && state.SciencePoints >= StoneKnappingScienceRequired {
        state.HasStoneKnapping = true
        unlocked = append(unlocked, "Stone Knapping")
    }
    
    return unlocked
}
```

#### 6. Update Simulation Loop (simulator.go)

```go
// RunSimulation (update food production call)
foodProduction := produceFood(foodHours, state.HasFireMastery, state.HasStoneKnapping, config.StartingConditions.TerrainMultiplier)

// Update technology unlock check
techsUnlocked := checkTechnologyUnlocks(state)
if len(techsUnlocked) > 0 {
    // Technologies unlocked!
}
```

#### 7. Update Viability Criteria (simulator.go)

The viability criteria changes slightly:

**Original (Fire Mastery only):**
- Simulation runs until Fire Mastery unlocked OR max days (3650 = 10 years)

**New (Multiple Technologies):**
- Simulation runs until BOTH technologies unlocked OR max days (7300 = 20 years)
- Viability = both Fire Mastery AND Stone Knapping unlocked within timeframe
- Fire Mastery expected: 5-10 years (1825-3650 days)
- Stone Knapping expected: 12-17 years total (4380-6205 days), 5+ years after Fire Mastery

```go
// Updated termination condition
if state.HasFireMastery && state.HasStoneKnapping {
    break // Both technologies unlocked - success!
}
```

## New Test Specification

### Test: Viability with Two Technologies

This test validates that populations can:
1. Survive long enough to research two technologies
2. Accumulate 200 science points (100 for each tech)
3. Benefit from both technology bonuses
4. Maintain viability with stacked bonuses

**Expected Behavior:**

With 70/30 food/science allocation:
- Fire Mastery unlocks after 5-10 years (100 science points)
- Stone Knapping unlocks 5+ years after Fire Mastery (500 science points)
- Sequential unlocking demonstrates progression through technology tree
- Combined food bonus (+38%) significantly helps population growth after both unlocked
- Test passes if Fire Mastery unlocked in 5-10 years and Stone Knapping within 15-20 years total

**Test Implementation:**

```go
// TestViabilityWithTwoTechnologies tests that populations can research both technologies
func TestViabilityWithTwoTechnologies(t *testing.T) {
    conditions := DefaultStartingConditions()
    
    viableCount := 0
    bothTechsCount := 0
    
    for _, seed := range VIABILITY_TEST_SEEDS {
        config := SimulationConfig{
            Seed:               seed,
            StartingConditions: conditions,
            MaxDays:            7300, // 20 years (to allow for sequential research)
        }
        
        result := RunSimulation(config)
        
        if result.IsViable {
            viableCount++
        }
        
        if result.HasFireMastery && result.HasStoneKnapping {
            bothTechsCount++
        }
    }
    
    // Both technologies should be researched in 100% of viable runs
    if bothTechsCount != len(VIABILITY_TEST_SEEDS) {
        t.Errorf("Expected all 50 seeds to unlock both technologies, got %d/%d", 
            bothTechsCount, len(VIABILITY_TEST_SEEDS))
    }
    
    // Viability rate should remain 100% with two technologies
    if viableCount != len(VIABILITY_TEST_SEEDS) {
        t.Errorf("Expected 100%% viability with two technologies, got %d/%d viable",
            viableCount, len(VIABILITY_TEST_SEEDS))
    }
}
```

### Test: Technology Bonus Stacking

This test validates that bonuses from both technologies stack correctly:

```go
// TestTechnologyBonusStacking tests that Fire Mastery and Stone Knapping bonuses stack
func TestTechnologyBonusStacking(t *testing.T) {
    baseFood := 100.0
    terrain := 1.0
    
    tests := []struct {
        name              string
        hasFireMastery    bool
        hasStoneKnapping  bool
        expectedMultiplier float64
    }{
        {"No technologies", false, false, 1.0},
        {"Fire Mastery only", true, false, 1.15},
        {"Stone Knapping only", false, true, 1.20},
        {"Both technologies", true, true, 1.38}, // 1.15 * 1.20 = 1.38
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := produceFood(baseFood, tt.hasFireMastery, tt.hasStoneKnapping, terrain)
            expected := baseFood * tt.expectedMultiplier
            
            epsilon := 0.01
            if result < expected-epsilon || result > expected+epsilon {
                t.Errorf("Expected %f, got %f", expected, result)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

1. ✓ `TestRandomGenerator_*` - Unchanged
2. ✓ `TestInitializePopulation` - Unchanged
3. ✓ `TestCalculateAvailableLabor` - Unchanged
4. ✓ `TestAllocateLabor` - Unchanged
5. ✓ `TestProduceFood` - **Updated signature** (add hasStoneKnapping parameter)
6. ✓ `TestProduceScience` - **Updated expectations** (much slower science rate)
7. ✓ `TestConsumeFood` - Unchanged
8. ✓ `TestUpdateHealth` - Unchanged
9. ✓ `TestCheckMortality` - Unchanged
10. ✓ `TestCheckReproduction` - Unchanged
11. ✓ `TestSimulation_BasicRun` - **Updated max days** (100 → 1000+ for meaningful progress)
12. ✓ `TestViabilityWithMultipleSeeds` - **Updated criteria** (both techs, 20 years, slower science)
13. ✓ `TestViabilityStatistics` - **Updated expectations** (longer timeframes)

Existing tests that call `produceFood()` need updated signatures:
```go
// Old
produceFood(hours, hasFireMastery, terrain)

// New
produceFood(hours, hasFireMastery, false, terrain) // false = no Stone Knapping yet
```

---

## Validation Criteria

### The implementation is successful if:

1. **All Existing Tests Pass**
   - No regressions in current functionality
   - Backward compatibility maintained

2. **New Tests Pass**
   - `TestTechnologyBonusStacking` validates correct bonus calculation
   - `TestViabilityWithTwoTechnologies` validates dual-tech research

3. **50-Seed Viability**
   - All 50 predefined seeds achieve both technologies

   - Follows existing code patterns
   - Well-commented for future expansion

---

## Future Expansion Path

This minimal expansion establishes patterns for adding more technologies:

### Phase 2: Third Technology (Future)
- Add Basic Foraging or Primitive Hunting
- Test three simultaneous technologies
- Different science costs (e.g., 50, 100, 150)

### Phase 3: Tech Prerequisites (Future)
- Add Level 1 technology (e.g., Advanced Tool-Making)
- Requires Stone Knapping prerequisite
- Test prerequisite validation logic

### Phase 4: Research Queue (Future)
- Allow player/AI to choose research order
- Multiple techs in progress simultaneously
- Research prioritization strategies

---

## Design Rationale

### Why This Is the "Smallest Increment"

**What Makes This Minimal:**

1. **Single Technology Added**: Only one new tech (Stone Knapping)
2. **No New Mechanics**: Uses existing science accumulation system
3. **Simple Effect**: Food production multiplier (like Fire Mastery)
4. **No Prerequisites**: Both techs available immediately
5. **Sequential Research**: Different science costs (100 vs 600) ensure sequential unlocking
6. **Minimal Code**: ~40 lines of production code
7. **Reuses Tests**: Existing test framework extended

**What This Validates:**

1. ✓ Multiple technology tracking
2. ✓ Technology effect stacking
3. ✓ Sequential technology unlocks (different timeframes)
4. ✓ Enhanced food production benefits
5. ✓ Long-term population viability (20+ years)
6. ✓ Realistic prehistoric research timeframes (5-10 years per major technology)

**What This Defers (Future Work):**

- ✗ Technology prerequisites (both are Level 0, no dependencies)
- ✗ Research queue/prioritization (sequential by cost, not player choice)
- ✗ More complex tech effects (unit unlocks, building types)
- ✗ Terrain/resource requirements
- ✗ Level 1+ technologies (requires prerequisite system)

4. **Test Sequential Progression**: Different science costs ensure technologies unlock in sequence
5. **Minimize Code Changes**: ~40 lines of production code, ~130 lines of test code
6. **Maintain Quality**: All existing tests updated, new tests added
7. **Enable Future Growth**: Establishes patterns for adding more technologies

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Stone Knapping chosen over alternatives for simplicity
- **Different science costs** (100 vs 600 points) for sequential research
- **Science rate adjusted** (~14x slower) for realistic 5-10 year timeframes
- Food production bonus (+20%) distinct from Fire Mastery (+15%)
- Technologies unlock sequentially over 12-17 years
- Viability criteria updated to require both technologies within 20 years

**Expected Outcome:**

After this expansion, the minimal simulator will demonstrate:
- Populations can research multiple technologies over realistic timeframes
- Technology effects stack correctly
- First technology (Fire Mastery) unlocks in 5-10 years
- Second technology (Stone Knapping) unlocks 5+ years later
- Simulation remains viable with enhanced capabilities over 20+ year spans
- Code is ready for further technology additions

This expansion represents a **focused, testable, incremental improvement** that validates core multi-technology systems with realistic prehistoric research timeframes while maintaining the minimal simulator's simplicity and reliability.
