# SimCiv Design Documents

This directory contains all design specifications for SimCiv, organized chronologically by version number.

## Document Organization

All design documents follow the naming convention: `0.00XX_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`

The version number indicates the **chronological order** based on the "Last Updated" or "Date" field in each document. This makes it easy to understand the progression of the game's development.

## Chronological Order Determination

The version numbers are assigned based on the chronological order determined by:
1. The "Last Updated" date field in implemented design documents
2. The "Date" field in bug fix and analysis documents
3. When multiple documents share the same date, they maintain their relative order within that date

This ensures that reading documents in numerical order provides a clear progression of how the game evolved over time.

## Reading Order

For understanding the complete system architecture, read documents in numerical order:

1. Start with authentication (0.0001)
2. Then game creation (0.0002)
3. Follow through map generation (0.0003)
4. Understand technology system (0.0004)
5. Learn population mechanics (0.0005, 0.0006)
6. Study map interactions (0.0007)
7. Review bug fixes and tuning (0.0008-0.0014)
8. Understand unit systems (0.0015, 0.0016)
9. Study civilization dimensions (0.0017)
10. Learn victory progression systems (0.0018)

Bug fix documents (0.0008-0.0014) can be read after their corresponding feature documents to understand implementation challenges and solutions.

## Cross-References

Design documents reference each other using their numbered names (e.g., `0.0003_MAP_GENERATION.md`) to maintain clarity about dependencies and relationships.

## Contributing New Designs

When adding new design documents:

1. Determine the date of the new design
2. Assign the next available version number (0.00XX) based on chronological order
3. Use the standard naming convention: `0.00XX_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`
4. Include the Document Status section with complete metadata
5. Reference related documents using their numbered names
6. Update this README to include the new document
