## Executive Summary

This document specifies the design for SimCiv's prehistoric military progression tree, one of four parallel civilization development trees. The military tree focuses on organized violence, defensive capabilities, and conquest strategies that enable territorial control and defense against rivals.

**Key Features:**
- Four-level military progression tree spanning 196,000 years of human conflict evolution
- Strategic choices between offensive and defensive doctrines
- Unit types and tactical capabilities that unlock new military options
- Integration with Technology, Cultural, and Economic trees through cross-dependencies
- Progression from tribal warriors to organized armies capable of siege warfare
- Foundation for Domination Victory path in later eras

This design establishes the military foundation that bridges into the Ancient Era military systems, providing players with strategic choices between aggressive expansion, defensive posturing, and military specialization.

---

## Architecture Context

The prehistoric military tree integrates with SimCiv's core systems:
- **Four Progression Trees**: Works alongside Technology/Science, Cultural, and Economic trees with cross-dependencies
- **Database Layer**: Stores military developments, unit types, and tactical capabilities
- **Simulation Engine**: Uses military status to determine combat effectiveness, unit availability, and conquest capabilities
- **Client Layer**: Displays military tree visualization, development progress, and unit information
- **Victory System**: Military progress enables Domination Victory through territorial conquest

The military system maintains independence while requiring support from other trees (technology for weapons, economy for unit upkeep, culture for morale).

## Timeline and Historical Context

### Evolution of Human Warfare

**Key Dates in Prehistoric Military Development:**

- **200,000 - 100,000 BCE**: Intergroup violence using basic weapons (clubs, stones, spears)
- **100,000 - 50,000 BCE**: Organized hunting tactics applied to warfare, coordinated group combat
- **50,000 - 10,000 BCE**: Advanced weapons (bows, throwing spears), defensive positions, tribal warfare
- **10,000 - 4,000 BCE**: Fortified settlements, organized raiding, early siege tactics, proto-armies

### Game Start Date: 200,000 BCE

The game begins when humans possess basic hunting capabilities but have not yet developed organized military systems. Military development parallels technological and social advancement.

**Rationale for Military Progression:**
- Reflects archaeological evidence of prehistoric violence
- Enables strategic military choices from earliest eras
- Provides combat mechanics appropriate to each era
- Creates military foundation for later civilizations

## Military Tree Structure Overview

### Four-Level Military Development Tree

The prehistoric military tree consists of four main levels, representing major stages in military capability:

**Level 0: Tribal Violence (200,000 - 100,000 BCE)**
- Basic combat capabilities
- Defensive postures
- Primitive weapons

**Level 1: Organized Warriors (100,000 - 50,000 BCE)**
- Coordinated combat tactics
- Specialized warrior roles
- Advanced weapons systems

**Level 2: Proto-Military Forces (50,000 - 10,000 BCE)**
- Organized raiding parties
- Defensive fortifications
- Combined tactics

**Level 3: Early Armies (10,000 - 4,000 BCE)**
- Standing military forces
- Siege capabilities
- Organized warfare doctrines

### Design Principles

1. **Offensive vs. Defensive**: Each level offers choices between aggressive and defensive military strategies
2. **Specialization**: Different military paths create distinct combat capabilities
3. **Cross-Tree Dependencies**: Military developments require technological, economic, and cultural support
4. **Unit Diversity**: Each path unlocks different unit types with unique capabilities
5. **Strategic Trade-offs**: Military investment competes with economic and cultural development
6. **Escalation**: Each level represents significant increase in military capability

Military points are generated through:

**Base Generation**:
- 1 military point per 10 population per turn (base rate)
- Modified by military developments
- Modified by active warfare (combat experience)
- Modified by military infrastructure

**Military Point Modifiers** (Cumulative):
- War Bands (Level 1): +20% military point generation
- Professional Warriors (Level 2): +30%
- Military Academies (Level 3): +40%
- Active warfare: +25% (learning through combat)
- Defensive fortifications: +10% (tactical thinking)

**Maximum Cumulative Bonus**: +125% military point generation by end of Level 3

### Research Requirements Scaling

**Population Requirements**:
- Level 0: 10-20 population minimum per development
- Level 1: 20-30 population minimum per development
- Level 2: 35-50 population minimum per development
- Level 3: 60-100 population minimum per development

**Military Point Costs**:
- Level 0: 80-120 military points (quick early military)
- Level 1: 200-280 military points (establishing doctrine)
- Level 2: 380-500 military points (military specialization)
- Level 3: 600-750 military points (ultimate capabilities)

### Military Prerequisites

Military developments have two types of prerequisites:

1. **Direct Prerequisites**: Specific earlier military developments
2. **Cross-Tree Prerequisites**: Technologies, economic systems, or cultural developments
3. **Tier Prerequisites**: Minimum military developments from previous levels

**Tier Prerequisites Summary**:
- Level 0: No prerequisites (all available at start)
- Level 1: Any 2 Level 0 military developments OR 3 Technology Tree developments
- Level 2: Any 3 Level 1 military developments
- Level 3: Any 4 Level 2 military developments

## Integration with Victory Conditions

### Domination Victory

Military developments directly enable Domination Victory:

**Requirements for Domination Victory**:
- Control >60% of map territories through conquest
- Destroy or subjugate rival civilizations
- Maintain military superiority preventing rebellion

**Critical Military Developments for Domination**:
1. **Siege Weapons & Tactics**: Essential for conquering fortified cities
2. **Combined Arms Warfare**: Necessary for defeating diverse enemy forces
3. **Elite Warriors** or **Mounted Raiders**: Provides military edge for conquest
4. **City Walls**: Protects conquered territories from counter-attack

**Domination Victory Path Example**:
- Early: Build basic military for defense and opportunistic raids
- Mid: Develop Professional Warriors and Combined Arms
- Late: Research Siege Weapons, conquer fortified rivals
- Victory: Control majority of world through military conquest

## Balance Considerations

### Military Investment vs. Other Trees

**Cost of Military Development**:
- Military units require food upkeep (reduces economic growth)
- Military points generated instead of culture or economic points
- Military infrastructure (forts, academies) competes with economic/cultural buildings
- Warfare casualties reduce population (slower research)

**Benefits of Military Development**:
- Protects other investments from rivals
- Can acquire resources through conquest
- Intimidation can provide tribute income
- Military reputation deters attacks

### Counter-Strategies

Each military path has counters:

1. **Heavy Infantry countered by**: Ranged units, mobility, economic strangulation
2. **Raiders countered by**: Fortifications, standing armies, retaliation
3. **Defensive Fortifications countered by**: Siege weapons, economic blockade, time
4. **Elite Warriors countered by**: Numbers, guerrilla warfare, economic exhaustion
