## Executive Summary

This document serves as the primary index and overview for SimCiv's prehistoric progression trees. The prehistoric era spans from approximately 200,000 BCE (emergence of modern humans) to 4,000 BCE (beginning of recorded history and ancient civilizations).

During this vast timespan, humanity developed the fundamental capabilities that would define all later civilizations: **technology** for understanding and controlling the environment, **military** organization for conquest and defense, **cultural** expression for identity and influence, and **economic** systems for wealth and resource control.

**The Four Prehistoric Progression Trees:**

1. **Technology/Science Tree** - Discoveries and innovations from fire to metallurgy
2. **Military Tree** - Organized violence from tribal skirmishes to early armies
3. **Cultural Tree** - Expression and influence from oral traditions to organized religion
4. **Economic Tree** - Resource management from subsistence to trade networks

Each tree contains 24-35 developments across four levels, providing strategic choices that define civilization character and enable distinct victory conditions.

## Progression Design Principles

### 1. Multiple Valid Paths

Within each tree, different strategic approaches are viable:
- Technology: Agricultural vs. Military vs. Cultural research focus
- Military: Offensive vs. Defensive vs. Mobile warfare
- Culture: Religious vs. Artistic vs. Entertainment focus
- Economics: Trade vs. Manufacturing vs. Resource extraction

### 2. Meaningful Trade-offs

Players cannot maximize all four trees simultaneously:
- Population is finite (specialists in one tree aren't available for others)
- Economic points split between trees (research vs. military vs. culture vs. trade)
- Infrastructure choices (temples vs. barracks vs. markets vs. laboratories)
- Time spent on one tree delays progress in others

### 3. Strategic Specialization

Successful civilizations typically:
- Choose a **primary tree** to advance toward their chosen victory
- Maintain **secondary support trees** for necessary capabilities
- Make **strategic trade-offs** accepting weaknesses for strengths
- Adapt to **geographic and strategic situation**

**Example Specializations**:
- **Military Conqueror**: Military primary, Technology/Economics secondary for weapons and upkeep
- **Cultural Influencer**: Culture primary, Economics secondary for cultural buildings
- **Trade Empire**: Economics primary, Military secondary for trade route protection
- **Scientific Leader**: Technology primary, Economics/Culture secondary for research funding

### 4. Era-Appropriate Complexity

Each level increases in sophistication:
- **Level 0**: Simple, immediate effects, quick research
- **Level 1**: More complex, synergistic effects, moderate research
- **Level 2**: Sophisticated systems, significant strategic choices, longer research
- **Level 3**: Advanced capabilities, game-changing effects, major investment

### 5. Historical Authenticity

Progression reflects real historical development:
- Technologies appear in historically appropriate order
- Military developments match archaeological evidence
- Cultural expressions mirror human cultural evolution
- Economic systems follow historical economic development

Each civilization makes independent strategic choices in Technology/Science, Military, Cultural, and Economic development, with cross-dependencies creating interesting trade-offs and realistic constraints.

**Key Design Achievements**:
1. **Four Equal Trees**: Each tree has similar complexity and strategic depth
2. **Multiple Paths**: Within each tree, diverse strategies are viable
3. **Meaningful Choices**: Cannot maximize all trees; must specialize
4. **Cross-Tree Integration**: Dependencies create realistic interdependence
5. **Historical Authenticity**: Progression reflects real human development
6. **Victory Diversity**: Four distinct victory paths plus diplomatic option
7. **Strategic Depth**: Emergence from simple strategic choices

**Gameplay Experience**:
- Early game: Establish foundations in all trees, begin specialization
- Mid game: Focus on primary victory path, maintain support trees
- Late game: Push for victory while defending against rivals
- Meta game: Learn optimal strategies, adapt to opponents

The prehistoric progression trees establish the foundation for SimCiv's complete civilization development system, with future design documents extending all four trees through Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Industrial, Modern, and Future eras.
