### Document Status
**Version:** 0.0020  
**Status:** Design Review  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Purpose:** Specification for the prehistoric cultural progression tree covering arts, religion, social organization, and cultural expression from 200,000 BCE to 4,000 BCE

---

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the design for SimCiv's prehistoric cultural progression tree, one of four parallel civilization development trees. The cultural tree focuses on artistic expression, religious development, social cohesion, and cultural influence that enable happiness, stability, and eventual Cultural Victory.

**Key Features:**
- Four-level cultural progression tree spanning 196,000 years of human cultural evolution
- Strategic choices between religious, artistic, and social development paths
- Cultural influence mechanics that spread values to neighboring civilizations
- Integration with Technology, Military, and Economic trees through cross-dependencies
- Progression from simple oral traditions to organized religious systems
- Foundation for Cultural Victory path through overwhelming influence

This design establishes the cultural foundation that bridges into the Ancient Era cultural systems, providing players with strategic choices between religious dominance, artistic excellence, and social organization.

---

## Architecture Context

The prehistoric cultural tree integrates with SimCiv's core systems:
- **Four Progression Trees**: Works alongside Technology/Science, Military, and Economic trees with cross-dependencies
- **Database Layer**: Stores cultural developments, influence levels, and happiness metrics
- **Simulation Engine**: Uses cultural status to determine population happiness, loyalty, and influence spread
- **Client Layer**: Displays cultural tree visualization, development progress, and influence maps
- **Victory System**: Cultural progress enables Cultural Victory through city defections

The cultural system maintains independence while providing benefits to other trees (morale for military, loyalty for economy, research speed for technology).

## Timeline and Historical Context

### Evolution of Human Culture

**Key Dates in Prehistoric Cultural Development:**

- **200,000 - 100,000 BCE**: Language development, basic symbolic thought, social bonding rituals
- **100,000 - 50,000 BCE**: Cave art emerges, spiritual beliefs develop, storytelling traditions
- **50,000 - 10,000 BCE**: Sophisticated art, burial practices, proto-religious systems, cultural identity
- **10,000 - 4,000 BCE**: Organized religion, monumental art, complex social hierarchies, cultural institutions

### Game Start Date: 200,000 BCE

The game begins when anatomically modern humans are developing language and symbolic thought but have not yet created complex cultural expressions. Cultural development parallels technological and social advancement.

**Rationale for Cultural Progression:**
- Reflects archaeological evidence of human cultural development
- Enables cultural strategic choices from earliest eras
- Provides social cohesion and happiness mechanics
- Creates cultural foundation for later civilizations

## Cultural Tree Structure Overview

### Four-Level Cultural Development Tree

The prehistoric cultural tree consists of four main levels, representing major stages in cultural sophistication:

**Level 0: Oral Traditions (200,000 - 100,000 BCE)**
- Basic social bonding
- Storytelling and shared identity
- Simple rituals

**Level 1: Symbolic Expression (100,000 - 50,000 BCE)**
- Artistic creation
- Spiritual practices
- Cultural traditions

**Level 2: Organized Culture (50,000 - 10,000 BCE)**
- Religious systems
- Cultural institutions
- Social hierarchies

**Level 3: Cultural Sophistication (10,000 - 4,000 BCE)**
- Organized religion
- Monumental art
- Cultural dominance

### Design Principles

1. **Diversity of Expression**: Multiple cultural paths (religion, art, social organization)
2. **Cultural Influence**: Culture spreads to neighbors, affecting their populations
3. **Happiness Foundation**: Cultural development increases population happiness
4. **Identity Creation**: Culture defines civilization character
5. **Cross-Tree Support**: Culture provides bonuses to military, economic, and technology development
6. **Victory Enablement**: Cultural influence can cause enemy cities to defect

## Culture Point Generation

### Culture Point Sources

Culture points are generated through:

**Base Generation**:
- 1 culture point per 10 population per turn (base rate)
- Modified by happiness (happier populations create more culture)
- Modified by cultural developments
- Modified by cultural specialists (priests, artists, bards)

**Culture Point Modifiers** (Cumulative):
- Storytelling & Myths (Level 0): +5%
- Religious Practices (Level 1): +15%
- Organized Religion (Level 2): +30%
- Cultural Academies (Level 3): +40%
- Great Temples (Level 3): +50% in cities with temples
- Happy population: +25%

**Maximum Cumulative Bonus**: +165% culture point generation by end of Level 3

### Research Requirements Scaling

**Population Requirements**:
- Level 0: 10-20 population minimum per development
- Level 1: 25-30 population minimum per development
- Level 2: 45-60 population minimum per development
- Level 3: 80-120 population minimum per development

**Culture Point Costs**:
- Level 0: 70-110 culture points (establishing identity)
- Level 1: 220-250 culture points (developing traditions)
- Level 2: 420-500 culture points (organized culture)
- Level 3: 720-900 culture points (cultural sophistication)

### Cultural Prerequisites

Cultural developments have prerequisites:

## Cultural Influence Mechanics

### Cultural Influence Spreading

Each civilization has a **cultural influence score** in every city (own and foreign):

**Influence Generation**:
- Base influence in own cities: 100 (full control)
- Influence in neighboring cities: Depends on cultural developments
- Influence spreads through: Proximity, trade, religion, art, performances

**Influence Spreading Modifiers**:
- Shared border: +20% influence spread
- Active trade route: +30% influence spread
- Same religion: +40% influence spread
- Cultural specialists visiting: +50% influence spread
- Temples/monuments visible: +35% influence spread

### Cultural Defection

**Defection Mechanics**:
- When your cultural influence in an enemy city exceeds their own by **200%**, that city defects to your civilization
- Example: If enemy has 100 influence in their own city, you need 200+ influence to cause defection
- Defection is permanent unless reconquered

**Cultural Victory Condition**:
- Control 60% of world's cities through cultural defection (not conquest)
- Achievable with dominant religious, artistic, or entertainment culture

## Integration with Victory Conditions

### Cultural Victory

Cultural developments directly enable Cultural Victory:

**Requirements for Cultural Victory**:
- Control 60% of world's cities through cultural defection
- Cultural influence in enemy cities must exceed 200% of their own influence
- Achieved through sustained cultural output and spreading

**Critical Cultural Developments for Victory**:
1. **Organized Religion**: Active conversion capability
2. **Great Temples**: Massive cultural output and influence
3. **Cultural Academies**: Sustained cultural spreading
4. **Olympic Games** or **Theater Culture**: Global cultural appeal

**Cultural Victory Path Example**:
- Early: Establish cultural identity and basic happiness
- Mid: Develop organized cultural systems (religion, art, performance)
- Late: Build Great Temples, spread culture globally
- Victory: Enemy cities defect due to overwhelming cultural influence

---

## Balance Considerations

### Cultural Investment vs. Other Trees

**Cost of Cultural Development**:
- Cultural developments compete with military and economic investment
- Cultural specialists don't produce military units or economic resources
- Cultural buildings (temples, theaters) compete with production buildings
- Time spent on culture delays technology research

**Benefits of Cultural Development**:
- Population happiness prevents unrest and rebellion
- Cultural influence can win peacefully (no military casualties)
- Research bonuses from several cultural developments
- Diplomatic benefits from cultural prestige
- Can weaken enemies through cultural influence

### Counter-Strategies

Cultural influence can be countered:

1. **Military Conquest**: Conquer culturally influential civilization before defections occur
2. **Cultural Isolation**: Avoid trade and contact with high-culture civilizations
3. **Competing Culture**: Build stronger culture to resist influence
4. **Economic Focus**: Generate wealth faster than culture can spread
5. **Rapid Expansion**: Control more cities than culture can influence
