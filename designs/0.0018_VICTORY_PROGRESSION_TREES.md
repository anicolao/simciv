# SimCiv Victory Progression Trees Design Specification
## Four Development Pathways to Victory

### Document Status
**Version:** 0.0018  
**Status:** Design Review  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Purpose:** Specification for four civilization progression trees (Technology/Science, Military, Cultural, Economic) that enable distinct paths to victory, with cross-dependencies creating strategic depth

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines four parallel progression trees that civilizations advance through to achieve victory. Each tree represents a distinct aspect of civilization development with its own strategic choices, resource requirements, and victory condition.

**The Four Trees:**
1. **Technology/Science Tree**: Fundamental discoveries and innovations (Fire → Metallurgy → Printing → Electricity → Quantum Physics)
2. **Military Tree**: Armed forces, tactics, and conquest capabilities
3. **Cultural Tree**: Arts, religion, entertainment, and social influence
4. **Economic Tree**: Trade, infrastructure, resources, and wealth generation

**Key Features:**
- Four equal progression trees, each with similar complexity and strategic depth
- Cross-dependencies between trees create realistic constraints and interesting choices
- Each tree leads to a specific victory condition
- Civilizations make unique choices in each tree, creating diverse development paths
- Diplomatic victory as a player-driven consensus mechanism (not tree-based)

**Victory Paths:**
- **Scientific Victory**: Technology/Science Tree → breakthrough discoveries (Mars colonization, AI singularity)
- **Domination Victory**: Military Tree → territorial conquest
- **Cultural Victory**: Cultural Tree → overwhelming influence causing defections
- **Economic Victory**: Economic Tree → control of global resources
- **Diplomatic Victory**: Player consensus based on diplomatic behavior

**Design Philosophy**: All four trees are civilization-specific progression systems. While technologies might be discovered similarly across civilizations, each civilization makes strategic choices about which technologies to pursue, which military doctrines to adopt, which cultural expressions to emphasize, and which economic systems to develop. Cross-dependencies between trees (e.g., advanced military units require certain technologies, cultural influence requires economic resources) create strategic depth without overwhelming complexity.

- **0.0017_CIVILIZATION_DIMENSIONS.md**: Core dimensions of civilization development
- **VISION.md**: Overall game vision including victory condition definitions

**Note**: The Technology/Science Tree documented in 0.0004_TECH_TREE.md currently covers only the prehistoric era (Level 0-3) but represents the foundation for one of the four main progression trees. Future design documents will extend all four trees through additional historical eras.

---

## Architecture Context

The four progression trees integrate with SimCiv's core game systems:

- **Four Progression Trees**: Technology/Science, Military, Cultural, and Economic trees advance independently with cross-dependencies
- **Database Layer**: Stores each civilization's progress on all four trees
- **Simulation Engine**: Uses progress across all trees to determine available actions, unit types, building capabilities, and influence
- **Resource System**: Different trees generate and consume different resource types (technology points, military points, culture points, economic points)
- **Victory Detection**: Tracks progress on each tree toward its associated victory condition
- **Cross-Tree Dependencies**: Developments in one tree may require achievements in others (e.g., certain military units require specific technologies)

**Key Architectural Principle**: All four trees are parallel progression systems. Each civilization makes independent strategic choices in each tree, with cross-dependencies creating interesting trade-offs without mandating any specific development path.

## Victory Conditions Overview

### Tree-Based Victory Conditions

Each of the four progression trees leads to a specific victory condition:

1. **Scientific Victory** - Achieved through the **Technology/Science Tree**: Reaching breakthrough discoveries (Mars colonization, AI singularity, or other era-defining achievements)
2. **Domination Victory** - Achieved through the **Military Tree**: Territorial control via military conquest
3. **Cultural Victory** - Achieved through the **Cultural Tree**: Overwhelming cultural influence causing city defections  
4. **Economic Victory** - Achieved through the **Economic Tree**: Control of >75% of global resources

### Special Victory Condition

5. **Diplomatic Victory** - Player consensus declaring a winner based on diplomatic prowess (not tree-based, achieved through diplomatic actions and player voting)

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Specialization with Trade-offs**: Advancing on one tree requires resources that could be spent on others
2. **Multiple Valid Paths**: Within each tree, different strategic approaches should be viable
3. **Emergent Synergies**: Combinations across trees create unique strategic opportunities
4. **Clear Progression**: Players should understand how their choices lead toward victory
5. **Historical Authenticity**: Progression paths should reflect real historical development patterns
6. **Balanced Competition**: No single tree should dominate; all paths to victory should be viable

### Tree Integration and Cross-Dependencies

All four progression trees advance in parallel, with cross-dependencies creating strategic depth:

**The Four Trees:**
1. **Technology/Science Tree**: Fundamental discoveries (Fire, Metallurgy, Printing Press, Electricity, Quantum Physics, etc.)
2. **Military Tree**: Military units, tactics, and conquest capabilities
3. **Cultural Tree**: Arts, religion, entertainment, and social influence
4. **Economic Tree**: Trade, infrastructure, resources, and wealth

**Cross-Dependency Examples:**

- **Military depends on Technology**: Advanced military units require certain technologies (e.g., Gunpowder for artillery, Internal Combustion for tanks)
- **Military depends on Economic**: Professional armies require currency systems and economic infrastructure for upkeep
- **Cultural depends on Technology**: Mass media requires electricity; printing cultural works requires the printing press
- **Cultural depends on Economic**: Building monuments and cultural wonders requires economic resources
- **Economic depends on Technology**: Advanced economic systems require technologies (e.g., electricity for modern infrastructure, computers for financial markets)
- **Economic depends on Military**: Trade routes need military protection; resource extraction may require securing territories
- **Technology depends on Economic**: Advanced research requires economic investment in universities and laboratories
- **Technology depends on Cultural**: Scientific institutions benefit from cultural developments (e.g., universities, written language)

**Key Principle**: Cross-dependencies exist in all directions between the four trees, creating interesting choices without being overwhelming. A civilization cannot maximize all four trees simultaneously - strategic trade-offs are necessary.

## Diplomatic Victory (Special Case)

### Victory Condition
**Diplomatic Victory** is a special victory condition that represents players collectively recognizing one civilization's diplomatic achievements and declaring them the winner.

### Mechanism

**Diplomatic Victory is NOT tree-based**. Instead, it functions as a democratic process:

1. **Voting System**: Once per era, players can call for a diplomatic victory vote
2. **Voting Requirements**: 
   - Must be in late Classical Era or later
   - Requires 75% of living player civilizations to vote "Yes" for the same candidate
   - Can only be called if at least 3 civilizations still exist
3. **Diplomatic Points**: Actions that enhance diplomatic standing:
   - Mutual defense agreements: +5 diplomatic points per partner
   - Trade agreements: +3 points per active trade route
   - Peace treaties maintained: +2 points per era
   - Shared research: +4 points per shared technology
   - Aid provided to struggling civilizations: +10 points per significant aid package
   - Cultural/Scientific/Economic achievements that benefit all: +15 points per achievement

### When Diplomatic Victory is Appropriate

Diplomatic Victory recognizes situations where:
- One player has clearly contributed most to global prosperity
- A player has maintained peace while others warred
- A civilization has provided critical aid preventing collapses
- Leadership has been so exceptional others willingly concede
- One player has acted as global mediator resolving conflicts

### Strategic Considerations

**Diplomatic Victory is the exception path**, not a primary development strategy. Players cannot "develop toward" diplomatic victory in the same way they develop military, science, culture, or economic power.

Instead, diplomatic victory rewards:
- **Consistent positive diplomacy** across all interactions
- **Being helpful** rather than exploitative
- **Maintaining alliances** even when costly
- **Sharing benefits** of your success with others
- **Peacekeeping** and conflict mediation

**Key Limitation**: Diplomatic victory requires OTHER PLAYERS to vote for you. You cannot force it through development, only earn it through behavior.

## Cross-Tree Dependencies and Synergies

### Critical Dependencies

Certain developments require progress in multiple trees:

**Examples**:

1. **Professional Armies** (Military Tree) requires **Currency** (Economic Tree)
   - Standing armies need payment systems

2. **Naval Supremacy** (Military Tree) + **Maritime Trade** (Economic Tree)
   - Synergy: Control seas militarily AND economically

3. **Mass Media** (Cultural Tree) requires **Electricity** (Tech Tree)
   - Cannot spread culture via TV/radio without power

4. **Space Colonization** (Tech Tree) requires **Industrial Production** (Economic Tree)
   - Building rockets requires massive industrial capacity

5. **Economic Supremacy** requires diverse tech and infrastructure
   - Must have Technology Tree advancement for advanced tech enabling economic tools

### Synergy Bonuses

Combining developments from multiple trees provides bonuses:

**Military + Economic Synergies**:
- Professional Armies + Banking = -30% military upkeep
- Naval Raiders + Maritime Trade = +50% plunder income
- Mechanized Warfare + Industrial Production = -40% tank production cost

**Cultural + Technology Synergies**:
- Literature & Drama (Cultural Tree) + Printing Press (Tech Tree) = +100% cultural spread
- Mass Media (Cultural Tree) + Computer Networks (Tech Tree) = Global cultural reach
- Religious Practices (Cultural Tree) + Medicine (Tech Tree) = +25% religious conversion (healthy populations more receptive)

**Economic + Technology Synergies**:
- Industrial Production (Economic Tree) + Engineering Science (Tech Tree) = +50% factory output
- Global Trade (Economic Tree) + Navigation (Tech Tree) = +40% trade route efficiency
- Automation (Economic Tree) + AI (Tech Tree) = -80% production costs

**Military + Cultural Synergies**:
- Organized Religion + Professional Armies = Religious military orders (+20% morale)
- Popular Culture + Modern Military = Cultural appeal reduces enemy resistance

### Balanced Development vs. Specialization

**Specialization Strategy**:
- Focus heavily on one tree
- Race toward victory condition
- Risk: Vulnerable to counters
- Example: Pure military rush can be economically strangled

**Balanced Strategy**:
- Develop multiple trees simultaneously
- More resilient to counter-strategies
- Risk: Slower victory, gives opponents time
- Example: Economic base funds military that protects cultural expansion

**Optimal Play**: Most successful civilizations develop a PRIMARY tree toward victory while maintaining SECONDARY support trees providing necessary resources and defense.

## Resource Types for Tree Progression

Each of the four progression trees requires different resource types:

### Technology Points (for Technology/Science Tree)
- Generated by: Universities, laboratories, research institutions, scholarly population
- Used for: Discovering and researching technologies
- Costs: Scientific education, research time, experimentation
- Boosted by: Large educated populations, scientific culture, previous discoveries

### Military Points (for Military Tree)
- Generated by: Training facilities, barracks, war academies
- Used for: Military doctrine and unit development
- Costs: Military unit production, active warfare experience
- Boosted by: Population willing to serve, military traditions

### Culture Points (for Cultural Tree)
- Generated by: Artists, priests, entertainers, cultural buildings
- Used for: Cultural expression and influence strategies
- Costs: Cultural works, religious conversion, entertainment production
- Boosted by: Population happiness, cultural traditions, great works

### Economic Points (for Economic Tree)
- Generated by: Trade, resource extraction, manufacturing, financial operations
- Used for: Economic systems and infrastructure development
- Costs: Infrastructure projects, trade agreements, resource acquisition
- Boosted by: Resource abundance, trade routes, financial sophistication

### Conversion Mechanics

Some resources can be converted between trees:
- **Gold → Technology Points**: Fund research directly (30% efficiency)
- **Gold → Military Points**: Hire mercenaries, buy equipment (50% efficiency)
- **Gold → Culture Points**: Patronize arts and religion (40% efficiency)
- **Technology developments → Military Points**: Apply technologies militarily (60% efficiency)
- **Technology developments → Economic Points**: Apply technologies economically (55% efficiency)
- **Culture Points → Economic Points**: Cultural tourism generates income (70% efficiency)
- **Military success → Economic Points**: Conquest provides resources (40% efficiency)

**Key Principle**: Direct generation is more efficient than conversion, but conversion provides flexibility. All four trees operate in parallel with each civilization making strategic choices about resource allocation.

## Implementation Considerations

### Database Schema

All four progression trees require database tracking:

```javascript
{
  civilizationId: ObjectId,
  
  // Four Parallel Progression Trees (all civilization-specific)
  progressionTrees: {
    technology: {
      unlockedTechnologies: [String], // Technologies discovered
      currentResearch: String,
      researchProgress: Number,
      technologyPoints: Number,
      technologyPointsPerTurn: Number
    },
    military: {

      currentDevelopment: String,
      developmentProgress: Number,
      militaryPoints: Number,
      militaryPointsPerTurn: Number
    },
    culture: {
      unlockedDevelopments: [String], // Cultural expressions and strategies
      currentDevelopment: String,
      developmentProgress: Number,
      culturePoints: Number,
      culturePointsPerTurn: Number,
      culturalInfluence: {
        [civilizationId]: Number // Influence in each other civ's cities

      }
    }
  },
  victoryProgress: {
    domination: {
      territoriesControlled: Number,
      totalTerritories: Number,
      percentage: Number
    },
    scientific: {
      technologyLevel: Number, // How far on Technology Tree
      breakthroughsAchieved: [String],
      finalBreakthroughProgress: Number
    },
    cultural: {

    },
    diplomatic: {
      diplomaticPoints: Number,
      votes: [ObjectId] // Civilizations voting for this civ
    }
  }
}
```

### UI Considerations

**Progression Tree Visualization**:
- Interactive tree display showing:
  - Unlocked developments (highlighted)
  - Available developments (clickable)
  - Locked developments (prerequisites shown)
  - Current research progress
  - Resource requirements

**Victory Progress Dashboard**:

- What-if scenarios (if I choose this, what unlocks?)
- Resource allocation calculator
- Synergy highlighter (show bonuses from combinations)

---

## Balance Considerations

### Preventing Dominant Strategies

1. **Counter-Play**: Each tree has counter-strategies from other trees
   - Heavy military → Economic strangulation
   - Economic focus → Military conquest
   - Cultural expansion → Military resistance
   - Scientific lead → Cultural/Economic interference

2. **Resource Scarcity**: Can't maximize all trees simultaneously
   - Population is finite
   - Gold splits between trees
   - Time spent on one tree delays others

3. **Synergy Requirements**: Single-tree focus has weaknesses
   - Military without economy collapses
   - Culture without defense is conquered
   - Science without resources stalls
   - Economy without military/culture is vulnerable

### Testing and Iteration

Balance requires extensive playtesting:
- Monitor victory condition frequency (should be roughly equal)
- Track successful strategies (ensure diversity)
- Identify dominant paths and nerf
- Buff underutilized developments
- Adjust costs and benefits based on actual play data

## Conclusion

The Victory Progression Trees system provides SimCiv with strategic depth through four parallel, interconnected progression trees. Each civilization makes independent strategic choices in Technology/Science, Military, Cultural, and Economic development, with cross-dependencies creating interesting trade-offs.

**Key Achievements of This Design**:

1. **Four Equal Trees**: Technology/Science, Military, Cultural, and Economic trees all have similar complexity and strategic depth
2. **Cross-Dependencies**: Dependencies exist in all directions between the four trees, creating realistic constraints without overwhelming complexity
3. **Strategic Specialization**: Within each tree, players choose specific paths creating diverse strategies
4. **Clear Victory Conditions**: Four distinct victory paths (Scientific, Domination, Cultural, Economic) plus Diplomatic
5. **Balanced Competition**: All victory paths are viable; no tree is treated as special or fundamentally different
6. **Historical Authenticity**: Tree structure reflects real civilization development patterns
7. **Resource Trade-offs**: Cannot maximize all four trees; must make strategic allocation decisions

**Integration with Existing Systems**:
- Builds upon the Technology Tree foundation (0.0004_TECH_TREE.md, prehistoric levels 0-3)
- Treats Technology/Science Tree as one of four equal progression systems
- Incorporates civilization dimensions (0.0017_CIVILIZATION_DIMENSIONS.md)
- Fulfills VISION.md victory condition requirements
- Provides concrete implementation path for strategic depth

**Next Steps**:

1. Extend all four trees through additional historical eras (Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Industrial, Modern, Future) in follow-up design documents
2. Define exact numerical values for all costs and effects in all trees
3. Create detailed cross-dependency charts showing prerequisites between trees
4. Design UI mockups for four-tree visualization
5. Implement victory detection algorithms for all four victory types
6. Create AI strategies for each victory path
7. Extensive balance testing and iteration

This system provides strategic depth by treating all four progression trees as equal systems with interesting cross-dependencies, allowing multiple paths to victory while requiring civilizations to make meaningful trade-offs in resource allocation.
