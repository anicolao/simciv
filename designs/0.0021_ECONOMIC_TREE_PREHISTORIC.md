## Executive Summary

This document specifies the design for SimCiv's prehistoric economic progression tree, one of four parallel civilization development trees. The economic tree focuses on resource extraction, trade systems, infrastructure, and wealth generation that enable economic power and eventual Economic Victory.

**Key Features:**
- Four-level economic progression tree spanning 196,000 years of economic evolution
- Strategic choices between resource extraction, trade networks, and infrastructure development
- Resource control mechanics that enable economic dominance
- Integration with Technology, Military, and Cultural trees through cross-dependencies
- Progression from simple barter to complex trade networks
- Foundation for Economic Victory path through resource control

This design establishes the economic foundation that bridges into the Ancient Era economic systems, providing players with strategic choices between manufacturing dominance, trade empire building, and resource extraction.

---

## Architecture Context

The prehistoric economic tree integrates with SimCiv's core systems:
- **Four Progression Trees**: Works alongside Technology/Science, Military, and Cultural trees with cross-dependencies
- **Database Layer**: Stores economic developments, resource control, and trade routes
- **Simulation Engine**: Uses economic status to determine production rates, trade efficiency, and resource availability
- **Client Layer**: Displays economic tree visualization, development progress, and resource management
- **Victory System**: Economic progress enables Economic Victory through resource control

The economic system maintains independence while supporting other trees (funds military units, supports cultural buildings, enables research infrastructure).

## Timeline and Historical Context

### Evolution of Human Economics

**Key Dates in Prehistoric Economic Development:**

- **200,000 - 100,000 BCE**: Basic resource gathering, minimal trade, subsistence living
- **100,000 - 50,000 BCE**: Tool specialization, resource exchange, early division of labor
- **50,000 - 10,000 BCE**: Long-distance trade begins, specialized crafts, resource management
- **10,000 - 4,000 BCE**: Agricultural surplus, permanent storage, complex trade networks, early currency

### Game Start Date: 200,000 BCE

The game begins when humans engage in basic subsistence activities but have not yet developed systematic economic behaviors. Economic development parallels technological and social advancement.

**Rationale for Economic Progression:**
- Reflects archaeological evidence of trade and specialization
- Enables economic strategic choices from earliest eras
- Provides resource management and production mechanics
- Creates economic foundation for later civilizations

## Resource Control Mechanics

### Resource Control Calculation

**Global Resource Pool**:
- All strategic resources tracked globally (metals, food, stone, luxury goods)
- Each civilization's control percentage calculated

**Control Methods**:
1. **Direct Ownership**: Resources in your territory (100% control)
2. **Trade Agreements**: Exclusive trade deals (50% control)
3. **Economic Monopolies**: Market control (75% control)
4. **Investment**: Economic influence in other economies (25% control)

### Economic Victory Condition

**Victory Requirement**:
- Control >75% of world's strategic resources
- Maintained for 20 consecutive turns
- Achieved through direct ownership, trade, monopolies, or economic influence

**Resource Types Counted**:
- Metals (copper, bronze, iron, precious metals)
- Food production capacity
- Luxury goods (rare, high-value items)
- Strategic materials (stone, wood, rare resources)

## Integration with Victory Conditions

### Economic Victory

Economic developments directly enable Economic Victory:

**Requirements for Economic Victory**:
- Control >75% of world's strategic resources
- Maintained for 20 consecutive turns
- Through ownership, trade, monopolies, or influence

**Critical Economic Developments for Victory**:
1. **Resource Monopolies**: Direct control of critical resources
2. **Global Trade Networks**: Access to all world resources
3. **Banking & Finance**: Economic influence over others
4. **Resource Extraction Economy**: Maximum resource production

**Economic Victory Path Example**:
- Early: Establish resource extraction and basic trade
- Mid: Develop specialized economy and trade networks
- Late: Achieve resource monopolies and global trade dominance
- Victory: Control 75%+ of world resources through economic power

## Balance Considerations

### Economic Investment vs. Other Trees

**Cost of Economic Development**:
- Economic developments compete with military and cultural investment
- Economic specialists don't produce military units or culture
- Economic buildings compete with military and cultural structures
- Trade requires peaceful relations (or military escort)

**Benefits of Economic Development**:
- Funds military units and cultural buildings
- Enables technology research through wealth
- Can win without warfare through economic dominance
- Provides resources for all activities

### Counter-Strategies

Economic dominance can be countered:

1. **Military Conquest**: Conquer economic powerhouses before they dominate
2. **Economic Isolation**: Refuse trade, deny access to resources
3. **Competing Economy**: Build stronger economic system
4. **Raiding**: Military harassment of economic infrastructure
5. **Alternative Resources**: Find substitutes for monopolized resources
