# Security Considerations for SimCiv

## Security Summary

The SimCiv authentication system implements several security measures as specified in the design document. This document outlines implemented security features, known limitations, and recommendations for production deployment.

## Implemented Security Features

### Authentication Security
- ✅ **Challenge/Response Authentication**: No password transmission over network
- ✅ **RSA-OAEP Encryption**: 2048-bit minimum key size with SHA-256
- ✅ **Single-Use Challenges**: Challenges marked as used after validation
- ✅ **Challenge Expiration**: 5-minute TTL for authentication challenges
- ✅ **Strong Key Validation**: Server validates public key format and strength

### Session Security
- ✅ **HttpOnly Cookies**: Prevents XSS cookie theft
- ✅ **Secure Flag**: HTTPS-only in production (configurable)
- ✅ **SameSite Attribute**: CSRF protection (Lax mode)
- ✅ **Session Expiration**: Configurable idle and absolute timeouts
- ✅ **GUID-Based Sessions**: Cryptographically random session identifiers

### Storage Security
- ✅ **Client-Side Key Encryption**: Private keys encrypted with AES-GCM
- ✅ **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations with unique salts
- ✅ **No Server-Side Passwords**: Passwords never transmitted or stored
- ✅ **GUID Namespacing**: Local storage isolation for multi-user support

### Input Validation
- ✅ **Alias Validation**: Non-empty string validation
- ✅ **Public Key Validation**: Format and strength verification
- ✅ **GUID Validation**: UUID v4 format verification
- ✅ **Challenge ID Validation**: Proper format checking

## Known Limitations and Recommendations

### 1. Missing Rate Limiting (High Priority)

**Status**: Not implemented in version 0.0001

**CodeQL Findings**: All authentication endpoints lack rate limiting

**Impact**: 
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks
- Susceptible to denial of service
- Resource exhaustion possible

**Recommendation for Production**:
```javascript
// Install express-rate-limit
npm install express-rate-limit

// Add to server.ts
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 10, // 10 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many authentication attempts, please try again later',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});

// Apply to authentication routes
app.use('/api/auth/challenge', authLimiter);
app.use('/api/auth/respond', authLimiter);
app.use('/api/auth/register', authLimiter);
```

**Implementation Priority**: Must be added before production deployment

### 2. Account Lockout (Medium Priority)

**Status**: Not implemented

**Issue**: No protection against repeated failed authentication attempts on a single account

**Recommendation**:
- Track failed authentication attempts per user
- Lock account after N failed attempts
- Implement time-based unlocking or admin intervention
- Log suspicious activity

### 3. Audit Logging (Medium Priority)

**Status**: Console logging only

**Issue**: 
- No persistent security event logging
- Difficult to track suspicious activity
- No audit trail for compliance

**Recommendation**:
- Implement structured logging (e.g., Winston, Pino)
- Log security events to persistent storage
- Include: authentication attempts, session creation, key rotation
- Consider integration with SIEM systems

### 4. IP-Based Protections (Low Priority)

**Status**: IP address captured but not used

**Recommendation**:
- Implement IP-based rate limiting
- Detect and block suspicious IP patterns
- Support IP whitelist/blacklist
- Consider geolocation-based restrictions

### 5. Additional Security Enhancements

#### Session Fixation Prevention
- ✅ Currently mitigated by GUID generation on first access
- Consider regenerating session GUID on authentication

#### Content Security Policy
```javascript
// Add to server.ts
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader(
    'Content-Security-Policy',
    "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
  );
  next();
});
```

#### Additional Headers
```javascript
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet());
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Add rate limiting to all authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement account lockout mechanism
- [ ] Set up structured logging and monitoring
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid certificate
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure secure cookie settings
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Implement session cleanup job
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Conduct security penetration testing
- [ ] Review and rotate any exposed credentials

## Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in SimCiv, please report it to the maintainers privately. Do not open a public issue.

## Security Testing

### Unit Tests
The codebase includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Cryptographic operations
- Key validation (including rejection of weak keys)
- Challenge generation and encryption
- GUID validation

### Test Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Run CodeQL analysis
# (Configured in CI/CD pipeline)

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerable dependencies
npm audit fix
```

## CodeQL Findings Summary

**Analysis Date**: Current implementation
**Total Alerts**: 10 (8 rate limiting, 2 intentional weak keys in tests)

### Critical Issues: 0
No critical vulnerabilities found.

### High Priority Issues: 8
All related to missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints.
**Status**: Documented for future implementation
**Mitigation**: Should be addressed before production deployment

### False Positives: 2
1024-bit RSA keys in tests are intentional - used to verify weak key rejection logic.
**Status**: Accepted - these are test cases for security validation

## Conclusion

The authentication system implements strong cryptographic foundations as specified in the design document. The primary security concern is the lack of rate limiting, which should be addressed before production deployment. All other security features are implemented according to the specification and follow industry best practices for challenge/response authentication systems.
