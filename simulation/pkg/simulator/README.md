# Minimal Simulator Implementation Notes

## Overview

This package implements the minimal viable simulator as specified in `designs/MINIMAL_SIMULATOR.md`. The simulator verifies that starting positions can support population growth and basic research capability.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Complete** - All components implemented and tested:

- Core data structures (`MinimalHuman`, `MinimalCivilizationState`)
- Deterministic random number generator (seeded LCG)
- All simulation mechanics per design specification
- Comprehensive unit tests with 50 hardcoded seeds
- Statistical validation across multiple runs

## Parameter Adjustments (Latest)

**Current Configuration** (as of latest commit):
- **Science Rate**: 0.002 (reduced by 500x from original 1.0)
- **Age Distribution**: 25% children, 60% adults, 15% elders (adjusted from 30/50/20)

These parameters were adjusted to:
1. Slow down Fire Mastery unlock to realistic timeframes (~3500 days / 9.6 years)
2. Increase working adult population for better productivity
3. Reduce non-productive population segments

## Key Findings

### Original Parameters (Science Rate = 1.0)

**Design Expectation**: Fire Mastery should be unlocked in 600-730 days (~2 years)  
**Actual Results**: Fire Mastery is unlocked in 7-10 days for viable seeds

**Root Cause**: The design document's "Expected Outcomes" section assumes players will manually adjust food allocation from 80% to 95%+ during early game crisis. However, the default 80/20 allocation actually works quite well:

1. Days 1-4: Population is fully fed (2.0 food/person)
2. Health increases from ~40 to ~55 during this period
3. Day 3: Average health crosses 50 threshold
4. Science production doubles (no more 50% health penalty)
5. Days 5-6: Food runs out, but science already at ~90 points
6. Day 7: Fire Mastery unlocked at 100 science points

**Why This Happens**:
- Young adults with full food ration GAIN health (+7.0 food bonus - 3.3 age penalty = +3.7/day)
- Health > 50 removes the 50% science penalty, doubling production
- Starting food (100 units) sustains population long enough for health to improve
- Once health improves, science production accelerates before starvation becomes critical

**Viability Results** (Original Parameters):
- **Viable**: 32% (16/50 seeds)
- **Fire Mastery Unlocked**: 32% (16/50 seeds)
- **Average Time to Fire Mastery**: 7.9 days (for successful runs)
- **Common Failure**: Population extinction or health decline before Fire Mastery

### Adjusted Parameters (Science Rate = 0.002, Age 25/60/15)

**Viability Comparison**:

| Metric | Original | Adjusted |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Science Rate | 1.0 | 0.002 (500x slower) |
| Age Distribution | 30/50/20 | 25/60/15 |
| Fire Mastery Time | 7-10 days | ~3500 days (>5 year limit) |
| Viable Seeds | 16/50 (32%) | 0/50 (0%)* |
| Surviving Populations | N/A | 48/50 (96%) |
| Final Population (avg) | N/A | 4.0 (20% of start) |
| Final Science (avg) | N/A | 0.24 points (0.24% of goal) |

\* No positions are "viable" by Fire Mastery criteria since it requires >5 years

**Impact of Adjustments**:
1. **Science Production**: 500x slower means Fire Mastery requires ~3500 days (9.6 years), which exceeds the 5-year simulation limit
2. **Age Distribution**: More adults (60% vs 50%) improves workforce but doesn't prevent long-term decline
3. **Survival vs Thriving**: 96% of populations survive but decline to ~20% of starting size
4. **Key Insight**: Default 80/20 food allocation is not sustainable long-term without science progression

**Analysis**:
With slow science production, the simulation reveals fundamental game balance issues:
- Populations can survive but cannot thrive with 80/20 allocation
- Without Fire Mastery (+15% food production), populations slowly starve
- Higher food allocation (90-95%) would be needed for sustainable growth
- The adjusted age distribution helps survival but doesn't solve the core food shortage

The 32% viability rate is below the design target of 60-80%, primarily because many seeds result in unfavorable initial population distributions (too few adults, unlucky age/health distributions, or early deaths).

### Reproduction Mechanics

Reproduction rates are very low in the minimal simulator:
- Base conception chance: 0.03/30 = 0.001 per day per pair
- With health=80, age=25: modifier = 0.6
- Final chance: 0.0006 per day = 0.06%
- Over a 10-day period for one pair: ~0.6% chance of birth

This low rate is intentional per the design (line 562-564) and matches expected prehistoric birth rates.

## Production Code Quality

The simulator is implemented as production-ready code:

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (mechanics, simulation loop, assessment)
- ✅ Proper error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Deterministic RNG for reproducibility
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Regression test suite with hardcoded seeds
- ✅ Statistical validation functions
- ✅ Well-documented code matching design specifications

## Future Evolution

This minimal simulator serves as the foundation for:

1. **Phase 2**: Full attribute implementation, multiple technologies, seasonal variation
2. **Phase 3**: Multiple civilizations, terrain integration, complex relationships
3. **Phase 4**: Real-time gameplay, multiplayer support, UI visualization

The current implementation maintains clean interfaces that will support these future extensions.
