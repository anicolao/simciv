- **Goal-Driven Actions**: Citizens work toward personal and civilizational goals
- **Responsive AI**: Population responds to player policies and environmental conditions
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Citizens learn from success and failure, adapting strategies over time
- **Social Dynamics**: Humans form communities, trade networks, and social structures organically

#### Emergent Systems
- Cities form naturally where resources and geography are favorable
- Trade routes develop based on supply, demand, and infrastructure
- Social classes and specializations emerge from economic conditions
- Cultural movements and trends spread through populations
- Military organization forms in response to threats and opportunities

### 2. Strategic Depth

**Goal**: Provide meaningful high-level decisions that shape civilization development.

#### Policy Systems
- **Economic Policies**: Tax rates, trade regulations, resource allocation
- **Social Policies**: Education investment, healthcare, cultural programs
- **Military Policies**: Defense spending, aggressive vs. defensive posture, unit priorities
- **Scientific Policies**: Research priorities, technology focus areas, innovation incentives
- **Infrastructure Policies**: Transportation, utilities, urban planning guidelines

- **Diplomacy**: Treaties, alliances, trade agreements, non-aggression pacts
- **Espionage**: Intelligence gathering, sabotage, technology theft
- **Trade**: Economic partnerships, resource exchanges, shared markets
- **Cultural Influence**: Spread of ideas, religions, and cultural practices

### 5. Organic Growth

**Goal**: Let civilizations develop naturally with minimal micromanagement.

#### City Development
- Cities grow organically based on:
  - Resource availability (food, water, materials)
  - Geographic advantages (rivers, coasts, strategic locations)
  - Transportation infrastructure
  - Population needs and desires
  - Economic opportunities
  - Defensive considerations

#### Infrastructure Networks
- **Roads and Paths**: Develop naturally between settlements and resources
- **Trade Routes**: Form based on economic incentives
- **Utilities**: Water, power, and communication networks expand with need
- **Defense Networks**: Walls, fortifications, and military bases built strategically

#### Building Construction
- Citizens decide what to build based on:
  - Personal and community needs
  - Available resources and technology
  - Player-set priorities and policies
  - Threats and opportunities
  - Cultural values and aspirations
